What does it do?  

============



  Recent years in the automotive domain, modern technologies have been playing a key role to increase the domain of autonomy of vehicles, resulting in the need for human intervention to perform a variety of tasks to greatly reduce. (Magliozzi 2019). Vehicles can already perform most common driving tasks, such as identifying road lanes, detecting pedestrians, and avoiding collisions. Further re-enforcing the anticipated future where all AI will acquire human functionalists and outperforms a human (Magliozzi 2019). Transition focus of vehicles from hardware to software is a crucial factor and the main enabler of fully autonomous vehicles (Magliozzi 2019). Google and Tesla are among the pioneers to push the autonomous driving-related software into the market, but at least 33 companies are working on autonomousvehicles.4Most of them had promised to put the autonomous car on the road by 2021, assuming that the necessary regulations will be put in place by then (Magliozzi 2019).  

  In addition to autonomous cars, there is a lot of interest in autonomous trucks. The companies working on developing autonomous trucks include Volvo AB, Daimler, Scania, Iveco, Komatsu, and Caterpillar. Autonomous trucks might have to deal with technology and social challenges even more than self-driving cars. From the technology perspective, autonomous trucks must coordinate their movements with other trucks so that they can drive closely in a platoon formation (Magliozzi 2019). Self-driving vehicles will have to operate in all sorts of situations. They will be requested to operate in unpredictable and uncontrollable environments that are dominated by uncertainty (Magliozzi 2019).

  Technological advancements together with increases of computational power and a huge amount of available data are making autonomous driving less of a vision and more of a reality soon (Magliozzi 2019). The main challenges for deploying autonomous vehicles are raised by the implicit nature of the vehicle: its connectivity to the external world and its self-adaptability situations in the environment. This openness allows vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication) or to the environment (vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication). Vehicles should be able to adapt to a different scenario in the environment without human intervention. (Magliozzi 2019).

  Artificial intelligence will play a key role in recognizing situations and in making optimal decisions (Magliozzi 2019). Artificial intelligence is the ultimate concept that will allow machines to perform any sort of task autonomously and in any situation (Magliozzi 2019). Fully autonomous vehicles require different machine learning techniques to be applied to several components of the vehicle. (Magliozzi 2019). To build an autonomous agent (i.e., an entity that can make decisions based on what it observes), there are three main tasks to be taken into consideration: perception, prediction, and planning. Machine learning can be applied in all of them (Magliozzi 2019). An interesting direction that is emerging is self-adaptive systems, that is, systems that can adapt their behavior at runtime without human intervention in response to changes in the environment or in their internal state (Magliozzi 2019). The size of the software in the vehicle has grown tremendously in recent years, and for this reason, the development cycle has moved from a rigid V-model (This process follows a V-shape starting from high-level requirements of each component going down to the implementation and then, up again to the verification of the integrated components) to more flexible agile methodologies where the iterations are much more frequent, thus enabling a fast feedback (Magliozzi 2019). Continuous evolution of a vehicle should additionally exploit the knowledge collected by other vehicles (Magliozzi 2019). Vehicles are no longer single monolithic systems, but they form a connected system of systems. A malfunction in one of the systems can propagate to other systems (Magliozzi 2019).

What is the impact?

What is clear today is that increased automation will define how cities are planned, changed, and built in the future. (Hörl 2016). Autonomous vehicles have the potential to drastically change not only the traffic environment, but also the way we see mobility, we design cities and, consequently, work and live in an increasingly. connected society with huge economic implications (Shanker et al., 2013) “(Hörl 2016). If all those assumptions are to become true, autonomous vehicles will not only revolutionize transportation, but dramatically change the urban form. By sub-statically reducing the generalized cost of travel, they may induce substantial amounts of additional travel demand and boost a new wave of suburbanization and urban sprawl (Mayer 2017).

The expected improvements in mobility can be explained in terms of capacity, which is either.

increased, leading to a more fluent traffic flow, or decreased, leading to congestion and lower.

travel speeds (Hörl 2016). As autonomous vehicles do not require a driver, they provide car travel also for people who are not able or allowed to drive today. Considered in this work are elderly, children, and adults without a driver’s license, because they represent the largest groups of additional users (Mayer 2017). Shared autonomous vehicles can provide the door to door, individual travel experience of private cars at low prices and without the financial burden and hassles of private car ownership (Mayer 2017).  

Substantial increases in accessibility can be expected from autonomous vehicles. Yet, the magnitude of the disruptions they will cause, strongly depends on the actual capacity gains autonomous vehicles can achieve (Mayer 2017). They allow passengers to perform non-driving activities during the ride. Comfort-wise, this makes traveling with shared autonomous vehicles extremely competitive if not superior to today’s forms of both conventional car ownership and public transportation. Thus, a substantial modal shift towards such new services can be expected (Mayer 2017).

How will this affect you?

  Moreover, unlike airplanes, we cannot assume to have professional drivers in cars, and most probably in the future, as a side effect of automation, we might even have drivers with degraded performance (Magliozzi 2019). Those individuals older than 65 years recognized that as they were aging such vehicles would be useful. “By the time they allow it on the road, it will be safer than my driving.” “As I get older, I would find this technology more and more appealing” “Easier as I get older. I get distracted and my reflexes are not as good as they used to be.” Even a couple of the persons ages 46-65 pointed out the benefits as they age. “Becoming disabled soon, I will not be able to drive myself.” “Also entering my older years, it will benefit me.” (Zmud 2017). AVs will impact aspects of mode choice and the built environment of people residing in much of the developed world, resulting in reduced walking and more sitting and sleeping. However, impacts on the demand for public transportation and parking are equivocal (Spence 2020). “I could do something productive on my trip.” “We waste a lot of time behind the wheel. To be able to be productive like on a plane or rail.” “It would let me do other tasks, such as eating, watch a movie, be on cell phone while you are on your trip.” “It would be easier to conduct business or for personal time.” “I spend a lot of time driving; it would be nice to be able to do other things.” “My commute is short, but it would allow me to do other things.” “Reduce stress of living in big city. Get in vehicle and work on other things. Make it a more productive trip.” (Zmud 2017).
