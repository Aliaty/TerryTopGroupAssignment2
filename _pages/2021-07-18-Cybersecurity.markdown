What does it do?

The volume of cyberthreats is staggering.

One research project put the number of attacks detected during the first quarter of 2020 at 445 million. That figure, from the Q2 2020 Fraud and Abuse Report released by Arkose Labs, represents a 44% increase over the prior quarter -- the highest attack rate ever detected in a quarter. Likewise, others have reported a rising number of attacks, as well as an increasing level of sophistication in those attacks.

The sophistication, diversity, speed and volume of attacks -- coupled with the growing complexity and reach of an enterprise technology stack that no longer has any real perimeter -- has made conventional manual-based security practices nearly obsolete.

Today's networked environments are extremely complex. Monitoring network performance is challenging enough; detecting unwanted behaviour that may indicate a security threat is even more difficult.

Traditional incident response models are based on a three-pronged concept: protect, detect and respond. Cybersecurity experts have long known that of the three, detect is the weak link. Detection is hard to do and is often not done well.

In 2016, Gartner unveiled its own predict, prevent, detect and respond framework that CISOs could use to communicate a security strategy. Machine learning is particularly useful in predicting, preventing and detecting.

Cybersecurity seeks to use AI and its close cousin, machine learning -- where algorithms that analyze data become better through experience

For cybersecurity professionals, that means using AI to take data feeds from potentially dozens of sources, analyze each of these inputs simultaneously in real-time and then detect those behaviours that may indicate a security risk.

Beyond the use of AI and machine learning in cybersecurity risk identification, these technologies can be used to improve access control beyond the weak username and password systems in widespread use today by including support for multifactor, behaviour-based, real-time access decisions. Other applications for AI include spam detection, phishing detection and malware detection.

AI-based security algorithms can identify malicious behaviour patterns in huge volumes of network traffic far better than people can. However, this technology can only identify the behavioural patterns the algorithms have been trained to identify. With machine learning, AI can go beyond the limits of algorithms and automatically improve its performance through learning or experience. The ability of AI -- and machine learning in particular -- to make decisions based upon data rather than rules promises to yield significant improvements in detection.

Systems embedded with intelligence technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing, analyze data from external sources, such as collective threat intelligence reports, as well as from within the enterprise. The systems use those analyses to search for and identify patterns that fall outside what they've been taught to recognize as acceptable or safe activities.

Consider how AI in security analytics can aid in security incident and event management. A typical security team today is processing thousands and thousands of data points, trying to make sure no hackers are sneaking in while also trying to stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities. An intelligent system could not only ingest and learn from real-time data feeds but could use that information to flag a novel threat -- something that is not exactly the same as what it had been trained to detect, but one it finds similar enough to identify as a problem.

In particular, technology can be a song, a song or ever. Articles on unity are similar to using the effects of military reasoning, planning, and analyzing major problems. In fact, technology is one of the world's leading companies.

What is the likely impact?

The use of AI in cybersecurity offers the possibility of using technology to cut through the complexity of monitoring current networks, thus improving risk and threat detection. However, the use of AI in cybersecurity is a two-way street. The use of malicious, AI, also known as adversarial, AI, is growing. A malicious actor could potentially use AI to make a series of small changes to a network environment that, while individually insignificant, could change the overall behaviour of the machine learning cybersecurity system once they are integrated over time.

AI can be a political reason: AI automates processes, advanced threats. It can be analysis of large volumes of activity out on the company's network with large volumes of files, files website employee access for a short time. Even so, AI is not 100% during the event, can be one of the largest and can be safe, allowing and growing sustainably.

- AI can learn over time: AI can identify malicious attacks on applications and the behaviour of the common network. Over time, AI-based cybersecurity solutions can learn about frequent access and micro-network applications and can detect frequent abnormalities.

- AI can be one of the world's leading companies such as AI can use English and synthesize information about the spread of threats, create smart educational institutions, analyze or and respond to threat.

This adversarial AI security threat is not limited to AI used in cybersecurity. It is a potential threat wherever AI is used, including in common industrial control systems and computer vision systems used in banking applications.

This means the AI models themselves are becoming a new attack surface component that must be secured. New security practices will have to be adopted. Some protection strategies will look like things we already know how to do, such as rate-limiting inputs and input validation.

Over time, AI adversarial training could be included as part of the supervised learning process. The uses and benefits of AI and machine learning in cybersecurity are real and necessary.There is too much data to process. It can take months to detect intrusions in today's large network data sets. AI can help detect malicious traffic, but it will take significant effort to develop and train an effective AI cybersecurity system. And as is the case with all technology, AI can also be deployed maliciously. Mitigating the impact of malicious, AI, is also a reality in today's security environment.

How will this affect you?

AI is a double-edged sword, in Cybersecurity, too, it can both help prevent, predict attacks, and can be a tool to attack. AI in Cybersecurity has a clearer influence on large organizations and organizations. However, for each individual user participating in the Internet system, this new technology will help each person to secure personal data in a better way. Cybersecurity systems using AI can scan and analyze vulnerabilities to send messages to users so that users can actively prevent attacks from stealing or losing control of personal information and accounts.

A year ago, Amazon was in a serious data crisis, when a series of their accounts were compromised in just one day. However, the security team does not advise users to change their passwords â€“ resulting in their information being shared on dark websites. Such a situation will not happen if they use AI login systems such as fingerprint, iris recognition, facial recognition, it will help secure information many times better. This technology will be very useful in the banking sector. Currently, some banks in Vietnam have gradually applied this technology, such as fingerprint login on smartphones, which is very convenient to use and also very safe.

Keeping networks and safety systems is a simple task. Maybe, it could be from AI and security networks. The benefit that comes in using someone in a security network is not comparable, from which the greatest reason is that the threat develops and reacts quickly. The most important thing is that AI technology is growing and once it plays a few key players in a network.
