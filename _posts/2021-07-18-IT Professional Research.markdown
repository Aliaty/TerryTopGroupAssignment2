'How To Become An Engineering Manager'
https://youtu.be/QiQiuNhNbtU
A software engineer manager in a nutshell, 'empowers' their team instead of doing the hands on work themself.
One way is to physically interact with your team. Conversations about careers
They also allocate jobs to the right person to provide coaching.
Lastly they would need to closely interact with other team managers, prepare to make decisions.
keep good communication between yours and the other team's manager.
it could be where your team is up to, and how well can your team meet the requirements of others, etc  

They spend most of their time meeting with other teams, and give support to their own team.
some rare cases would even act as manager of another team in their team manager's present.

One of the hard parts about the job is knowing where to 'focus' your time to do what.
If you are good you know how to 'share your lego' enabling your team to achieve higher goals.
also have to deal with relations between teams. 'sometimes people just don't like each other'
make sure people have the right skill set for the right work.
