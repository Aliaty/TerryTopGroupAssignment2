Aidan:
When looking at the data supplied by burning glass it can be seen that Generalised skills such as communication and teamwork are of high demand and are an integral part of being a Information systems security engineer.

Kim:
Some of the more in-demand IT-specific skills to become a Full Stack Developer are SQL, JavaScript, and use of Git. Top generic skills for Full Stack Developers include communication skills, teamwork and collaboration, troubleshooting, and requires organisational skills.

The highest ranked IT skills not in the required skill set are: SAP, business management, business analysis. The highest ranked general skills not in the required skill set are: writing, planning, and research.

Looking at the job data, it seems front end developers have more job availability than full stack developers. I think I could shift my focus to primarily learning front end development and languages due to the greater demand of front end developers.


Tony:
The skill Set of software engineering manager ranges from the some of the most demanding skill set like communication and team working skill
while at the same time also require some of the least demanding skill sets like management decision making.
Some demanding skills that are not required in my roles are problem solving, organising and writing.
My job is that it has some highly transferable skill sets making it very versatile in terms of how well the skill set can transfer to other jobs.
After looking at burning glass data my opinion on my ideal job has not changed.

Sophia, A 2020, What do front end developers *actually* do?, YouTube, 25 May, viewed 16 July 2021, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCy5zXmlrfc>.
 • What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
The front end developer’s main role is coding of a website. They use coding languages, resources, and web applications such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, Git, and front end frameworks such as AngularJS, ReactJS, and Bootstrap. They will troubleshoot bugs in the code and test if it works properly in all browsers and devices such as mobile or tablets.

• What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The  general public?

Front end developers collaborate with colleagues including product managers who discuss and obtain client needs and goals, UX designers who create website designs based on client requests that the developer will then follow, other developers such as full stack/mobile/lead who directly collaborate with the front end developer and the coding, and a digital marketing department who can request website features to be added.

• Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?
The front end developer spends around 70% of their time coding, but also collaborating using platforms such as Git to share coding work and ideas with other developers. Some time is also spent testing code and troubleshooting. Front end developers spend around 20% of the time in collaborations and meetings, and it keeps the team on track to be productive, focus on targets, and opportunity to voice concerns or problems.


• What aspect of their position is most challenging?
Having to be able to use different libraries due to different teams using other resources requires you to be adaptable and flexible to change. Having communication breakdowns would be a huge issue in this role as collaboration with other team members and their areas of expertise is essential to create a cohesive end product.

'How To Become An Engineering Manager'
https://youtu.be/QiQiuNhNbtU
A software engineer manager in a nutshell, 'empowers' their team instead of doing the hands on work themself.
One way is to physically interact with your team. Conversations about careers
They also allocate jobs to the right person to provide coaching.
Lastly they would need to closely interact with other team managers, prepare to make decisions.
keep good communication between yours and the other team's manager.
it could be where your team is up to, and how well can your team meet the requirements of others, etc  

They spend most of their time meeting with other teams, and give support to their own team.
some rare cases would even act as manager of another team in their team manager's present.

One of the hard parts about the job is knowing where to 'focus' your time to do what.
If you are good you know how to 'share your lego' enabling your team to achieve higher goals.
also have to deal with relations between teams. 'sometimes people just don't like each other'
make sure people have the right skill set for the right work.
